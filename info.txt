Step 1: 


    * Go to the above web link page and follow the steps on video link then scroll down and move to macOS section

    * Go to your Macbook system home path terminal not your react Native project directory

       ex : santhakumar@Santhas-MacBook-Air ~ % 

       not like this :  santhakumar@Santhas-MacBook-Air ~ test_app % 

    *  then run below command on the terminal

        /usr/libexec/java_home

    *  then you will get path of your system Home directory 

            ex : /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home

    * then run below command

        cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home

    * then you will get path of your system like santhakumar@Santhas-MacBook-Air Home % 

    * then run below command without any changes

        sudo keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

    * then enter your system password

    * then enter keystore password whatever you want, I will enter the password for this project is 
      " testapp "

    * key store ( jks ) file created successfully on this path (/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home)

    * then go to that path and copy keystore(jks) file and paste it in your project " android/app/ " folder

    * then go to android/gradle.properties folder and paste below lines on the end of the line in this file


        MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=my-upload-key.keystore
        MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
        MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
        MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=*****

    * then open android/app/build.gradle file

        ...
            android {
                ...
                defaultConfig { ... }
                signingConfigs {
                    release {
                        if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE')) {
                            storeFile file(MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE)
                            storePassword MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD
                            keyAlias MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS
                            keyPassword MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD
                        }
                    }
                }
                buildTypes {
                    release {
                        ...
                        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
                    }
                }
            }
            ...

        * add signinConfig release into buildTypes and add release content into signinConfig

        * then go to your project terminal and run below command one by one

                cd android

                ./gradlew clean

                ./gradlew bundleRelease

        * it take some time finally you will get release bundle build on the particular location

        * then go to below path to see your release build

            android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release 

            there you will get app-release.aab file

        * thats it...
